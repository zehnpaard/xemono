Statically typed impure functional programming language based strongly on OCaml, with influences from Python, Haskell and Clojure

Features:

* Hindley-Milner type inference
* Algebraic Data Types and pattern matching
* Lexical scoping
* Variable definitions as name-bindings
* Mutable ref and array types
* Significant indentation
* Literals and comprehensions for common data structures
* where and let bindings to specify variable scope

Areas to investigate:

* Modular implicits
* Monad/Applicative interface
* Lazy streams as unifying data structure interface
